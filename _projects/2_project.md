[Cognimates](cognimates.me) is an AI education platform for building games, programming robots & training AI models. I created this platform as part of my [master thesis](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/growing-up-with-ai/) at MIT Media Lab in 2018. The platform is currently being used in more than 120 countries and has over 5000 unique visitors per month. All of the code developed for this platform is open-source.


The Cognimates platform is composed of four main components:
* ### 1.Codelab

### Image prediction project
In this project children can guess if a drawing will be classified as an unicorn or narwhal based on a custom image classification model they trained using their own examples of images.

### Microscope project
In this project children can interactively train a model to recognize new microscope images and assign new labels to them.
