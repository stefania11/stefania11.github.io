In this project I aim to investigate what evidence of homophily and heterophily we can identify when observing children's activity on an Scratch online programming platform. I specifically seek to understand how some algorithmic interventions, such as featuring remixed projects on the homepage, influence the diversity of children's interactions. I hypothesize a more diverse network could lead to an increase in platform retention and therefore to an improvement in children's programming practice.

### Working definitions:

* __Homophily__ refers to the degree to which pairs of individuals who interact are similar with respect to certain attributes, such as beliefs, values, education, social status, etc.
* __Heterophily__ is the degree to which pairs of individuals who interact are different with respect to certain attributes.
* __Network diversity__ in our project is defined as multidimensional heterophily measured across the following dimensions: gender, age, language of platform users.
* __Computational thinking__ involves three key dimensions: (1) computational concepts (i.e. events, parallelism) (2) computational practices (i.e. iterating, remixing, abstracting), and (3) computational perspectives(i.e. expressing, questioning).
