This project is very much a work in progress. After a series of longitudinal studies in the home with international families I created a series of activities, games and printouts to support families to learn more about AI by playing and by doing. I will be rolling out these ressources and adjacent publications in 2021.

See below some examples of ressources from the family AI Playground project.

### Printouts of guidelines for AI literacy
Series of activities and guidelines for the Family AI Literacy framework I proposed in this [Journal for Algorithmic Fairness for Youth](/assets/pdf/JODS_Author_Draft_The_4As__Ask__Adapt__Author__Analyze___AI_Literacy_Framework_for_Families.pdf).
